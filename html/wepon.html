                        <p class="text-white fs-6">The Marathas by their valour, ferocity and martial skills, have traditionally been a warrior force to reckon with. In the 18th century, they created a large empire encompassing a major part of Deccan and central India (besides
                            strong influence in regions of northern and eastern India). The marathas relied mainly on their infantry and cavalry during war. The mountainous terrain of the Sahyadris made the Marathas a strong, nimble footed and athletic
                            lot. <br> The terrain also made them use light weaponary especially during the gureilla type of war that they fought. This enabled them to make quick movements and swift strikes on unsuspecting enemies and then disappear into
                            the darkness of the night or the shield of the thickly vegetated mountains during the day,The terrain also made them use light weaponary especially during the gureilla type of war that they fought. This enabled them to make
                            quick movements and swift strikes on unsuspecting enemies and then disappear into the darkness of the night or the shield of the thickly vegetated mountains during the day, (before the enemy could gather their wits).Ofcourse,
                            with increase in their military power, their gureilla style often made way for the open pitch style of warfare. <br> It also brought in a certain amount of sophistication in their weaponary. Some of the medieval weapons traditionally
                            used by the Marathas were the variants of swords like the talwaar, the firangi, the khandaa, the paataa ,and the variety of daggers like the kataar, the shamsher,the jaambiya . Also prevalent were the ancient bhaalaa (spear),
                            dhanushya baan (bow and arrows), kurhaad( battle axe), parshu (axe variant), gadaa / gurz (mace) or unique weapons like the waagh nakh (tiger claws). These weapons were made as per the quintessential designs borrowed from the
                            Rajputs, the Mughals,the Persians,the Afghans and the Europeans. But were often modified to suit the Maratha style of martial art.

                        <p class="text-white">
                            <b>Talwar</b> is an Indian sword, with a curved blade, with the hilt covered by the enclosed flange, which extends from the guard to the pommel. It is often double edged and having a pointed tip. The talwar was used by both
                            the infantry as well as the cavalry because of its effective draw cut. The handle of the talwar often displayed intricate engravings. <br> <b>Firangi</b> is an sword with a long straight heavy blade like its European counterpart
                            and a pointed tip. It has a full sharp edge on one side and the other side has around six inch sharp edge.It was used by the cavalry.The hilt has a knuckle guard (basket hilt). Shivajis famous 'Bhavani ' & 'Jagdamba' talwar
                            were styled in this fashion. Kirach is an sword similar to the firangi, except that the blade is broad, single edged and comparatively short and having a basket hilt.
                            <br><b>Shamsher</b> is a sword in its Persian form. The blade is generally curved (but also straight and double edged) like the talwar but less wide. It has a slash cut operation. There is no pommel and the hilt continues in
                            a curve.

                                <p class="text-white" style="text-align: justify;">The year was 1659. A port named Banda near the Konkan coast had a Portuguese ship stuck on it due to shallow waters. A resident of that region and a soldier of Shivaji Maharaj by the name Ambaji Sawant raided that Portuguese
                                    ship and found in it an impeccable, stone studded European sword. During that period Shivaji Maharaj was on a tour of the Konkan region. He visited the Saptakoteshwar temple in the region and there Ambaji’s son Krushnaji
                                    Sawant met Shivaji Maharaj. Overwhelmed by the presence of such a great leader and the king of kings, Krushnaji gifted the sword acquired by his father to Shivaji Maharaj on 7th March, 1659. Shivaji Maharaj, seeing
                                    the sword was certainly impressed and loved it immediately. He asked Krushnaji for its price, as a king was not supposed to accept free presents from his people. Krushnaji denied taking the money, but as Shivaji Maharaj
                                    insisted, he accepted 300 hun (as of today, 1 hun~ Rs. 2,40,000). Later Shivaji Maharaj named this sword as Bhawani. Bhawani sword’s today’s minimum market price would be 300 hun i.e Rs. 7.2 crores.</p>

                            <p class="text-white" style="text-align: justify;">The year was 1662. Shivaji Maharaj’s father Shahajiraje was on a tour of the Pune region. Citing the immense progress his son had been able to achieve as a Maratha king, he decided to gift him a sword. This sword was gifted
                                to Shivaji Maharaj by Shahajiraje at Jejuri. This sword was named as Tulja.

                            <p class="text-white" style="text-align: justify;">Being impressed by the light weighing, swift, long and straight sword of Bhawani, Shivaji Maharaj decided to enable his soldiers with the same types of swords. So, he placed an international tender and asked the British, Dutch,
                                Portuguese, French and the other European powers to accept the order. Almost every European power was well acquainted with the greatness of Shivaji Maharaj as a leader and saw in him a threat to their colonial ambitions.
                                Hence, they denied to accept the order. But there was one European nation located in between France and Portugal, then not very strong economically as compared to its neighbours accepted the order. It was Spain. The head
                                of Spain accepted the order and thousands of European blades started to embark for India. Being overwhelmed by the vastness of the order and for trusting such a small country in the presence of strong European powers, the
                                head of Spain gifted a brilliant, stone studded, exemplary and a stainless sword to Shivaji Maharaj. This was the Jagdamba sword. In 1875, the British tactfully got hold of this sword from a descendent of Shivaji Maharaj
                                and took it to England. It’s today’s location is Royal Museum, London.

                                A bagh nakh is an Indian hand-to-hand weapon designed to fit over the knuckles or concealed under and against the palm. It traditionally consists of four or five curved blades affixed to a crossbar or glove, and is designed to slash through skin and muscle,
                                mimicking wounds inflicted by a wild animal. The bagh nakh is similar to brass knuckles or neko-te. The weapon was developed in India, primarily for self-defence, though there are conflicting reports of the time period
                                in which they appeared. The first well-known usage of the weapon was by the first Maratha Emperor Shivaji. He used a variation of the bagh nakh (the Bich'hwa bag'hnak) to kill Afzal Khan, a Bijapur Sardar.
