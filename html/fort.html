            <b>Shivneri</b> is a hill fort located to the northern side of Pune
            district with Junnar at its base and was the birth place of
            Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj. Even though the fort has succumbed to
            the ravages brought on by time and weather, its structural style is
            worth a study. The spot where Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj was born
            was reconstructed in 1925 and is known as the Shiv Mandir. In its
            vicinity is a huge circular water tank called Badami Talav. However,
            it does not hold water any longer. At the far side to the north is a
            precipitous cliff. This narrow channel is known as the Kadelot
            Point. It is believed that criminals awarded capital punishment were
            handcuffed and thrown down from here. It is from here that one can
            get a good view of the Manikdoh Dam as also the forts of Hadsar and
            Chavand. Climbing further you will be able to see the hill fort of
            Harishchandragad, far behind the mountains. Some of the other views
            include those of Narayangad, Lenyadri Hill, Arvi Satellite Centre’s
            antenna and the Giant Meter wave Radio Telescope (GMRT) at Kodad
            near Pune.
