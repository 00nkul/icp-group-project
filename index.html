                Rajgad (literal meaning Ruling Fort) is a hill fort situated 
                in the Pune district of Maharashtra, India. Formerly known as
                 Murumdev, the fort was the capital of the Maratha Empire under
                  the rule of Chatrapati Shivaji Maharaj for almost 26 years,
                   after which the capital was moved to the Raigad Fort.
                   Treasures discovered from an adjacent fort called Torna were
                    used to completely build and fortify the Rajgad Fort.

                Lohagad (iron fort) is one of the many hill forts of
                Maharashtra state in India. Situated close to the hill
                station Lonavala and 52 km (32 mi) northwest of Pune, 
                Lohagad rises to an elevation of 1,033 m (3,389 ft) 
                above sea level. The fort is connected to the neighboring
                Visapur fort by a small range. The fort was under
                the Maratha empire for the majority of the time,
                with a short period of 5 years under the Mughal empire.

                Torna Fort, also known as Prachandagad, is a large
                fort located in Pune district, in the Indian state
                of Maharashtra. It is historically significant 
                because it was the first fort captured by Shivaji
                Maharaj in 1646, at the age of 16. The hill has
                an elevation of 1,403 metres (4,603 ft) above
                sea level, making it the highest hill-fort in 
                the district. The name derives from Prachanda 
                (Marathi for huge or massive) and gad (Marathi for fort).

                Vijaydurg (Viziadurg), the 
                oldest fort on the Sindhudurg coast, was constructed
                during the regime of Raja Bhoja II of the Shilahar 
                dynasty (construction period 1193-1205) and restructured
                by Shivaji maharaj.
                Earlier, the fort encompassed an area of 5 acres
                and was surrounded by sea on all four sides. 
                Presently the area of fort is about 17 acres and is 
                surrounded by the Arabian Sea on three sides.
                Shivaji maharaja extended the area of the
                fort by constructing three walls on the eastern side, 
                each 36 metres high. He also constructed 20 bastions.

                Many constructions and structures on Raigad were built by Chhatrapati

                eventually covering much of western and central India.

He is considered to be one of the greatest warriors of his time and even today, stories of his exploits are narrated as a part of the folklore. With
                        his valor and great administrative skills, Shivaji Maharaj carved out an enclave from the declining Adilshahi sultanate of Bijapur. It eventually became the genesis of the Maratha Empire. After establishing his rule, Shivaji Maharaj
                        implemented a competent and progressive administration with the help of a disciplined military and well-established administrative set-up. Shivaji Maharaj is well-known for his innovative military tactics that centered around non-conventional
                        methods leveraging strategic factors like geography, speed, and surprise to defeat his more powerful enemies.
